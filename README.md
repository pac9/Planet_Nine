Using Javascript, APIs, MongoDB, Pub/Sub pattern, Express.

# Brief

## Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts.

The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Explore the Solar System - navigate through planets and display information
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some interactivity that enables a user to move through different sections of content

## Examples of further features

- Bring in data using an API or create your own
- Use charts or maps to display your information

## API, Libraries, Resources

- https://www.highcharts.com/ HighCharts is an open-source library for rendering responsive charts.
- https://leafletjs.com/ Leaflet is an open-source library for rendering maps and map functionality.

## Project Guidelines

AIMS/PURPOSE:

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these
- To have the opportunity to try using Agile working methods
- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork. 
- To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO front-end frameworks or jQuery are allowed. If you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

EXPECTATIONS/WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE:

- All members of the group contributing to the planning, development and presentation of the project
- Members supporting each other - making sure everyone can get the most they can from the week
- Some TDD - unit testing of models
- Some application of Agile concepts e.g. a morning standup, sprints, a kanban board (Trello)
- Regular Git commits and use of branches
- Frequent merges
